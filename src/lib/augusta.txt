Problem that Augusta Labs is tackling: 
* Inefficient processes cost companies 20-30% of their annual revenue
* Immersion in routine work and bureaucracies, most employees spend time on routine work and repetitive tasks
* Lack of technological knowledge. It is difficult for companies to catch up with the pace of technological advancements
* Aversion to new technologies that make current processes quicker and more efficient 
* Inefficient processes that still achieve the defined objective are rarely reviewed and that causes “silent costs”


We saw this problem in first hand by working at Technology and Strategic Consulting market leader such as:
* Sword Health, a leading portuguese technological unicorn, we implemented multiple new processes to accelerate the speed and output of the different teams while reporting directly to the CEO
* At McKinsey & Company, we've assisted numerous clients across various sectors and industries in automating their workflows, generating deep insights into the primary challenges and opportunities present in the large corporate market


And it became clear that Artificial intelligence is the solution, why?
* 70% Working time that can be automated
* 30% Potential operational cost reduction
* 4 in 5 Companies consider AI their main business priority
